# What Does Earth-Colder Do?
Global warming is a prolonged environmental issue that needs urgent actions. We are surpring to know that deforestration adds more carbon dioxide to atmosphere, one of the major reason that causes Global Warming, than the sum of commuting emission on road. Therefore, we think figuring out how to stop deforestration is the primary concern in solve Global Warming issues.

## Problem Statement
What we want to achieve is to not only provide a way for common people to help planting trees in needing area despite of their financial situations but also remind and encourage them in their everday life to conduct pro-environment actions and constantly pay attention to how they can help with Global Warming and Deforestration issues. So, we want to create a virtual place where people can grow a virtual tree by doing pro-environmental activities.

## Design Component

Branding:

We chose Ant design as our branding component and execute the design style basically in every stage of our prototype. Except using same Color palette and font for typical gamification app of Ant Design, we also used same alignment rules and navigation patterns. In our friend list page, we used side navigation to provide a more flexible menu item and enable unlimited number of items.

Data Visualization:

When user collects more energy, the tree will grow to a bigger one, along with the visual change of progress bar at the top right of this web page. The progress bar is also demonstrating the visual relationship between the leaves and the tree because as user collects the leaves, the progress will be filled in, and then the tree will grow larger when the bar reaches a certain point.

Social Interactions:

We let users interact with other’s trees and change the data on both systems when they steal a leaf. This could encourage them to collect leaves in time to prevent be stolen from others and also engage with their friends in an amusing way. We also let users to leave a comment. This could encourage them to interact as they have the option to express what on their mind when seeing other’s page and what they want to say after stealing the energy.
